# wte4j - word template engine for java

## What is wte4j?
Wte4j is a Spring component that generates Open XML documents from a template.
As a template one can use .docx or .dotx files with content-controls used by Microsoft Word as placeholders for the dynamic content. wte4j is using docx4j and apache poi to parse and build word documents.
For a more detailed documentation visit this project's [wiki] (https://github.com/wte4j/wte4j/wiki). 

You can find the latest release of the wte4j project archived as .zip and .tar.gz files in the [release area](https://github.com/wte4j/wte4j/releases) or the separate modules in the maven central repository.

## What do you get?
Wte4j consists of five modules:

- **wte4j-core** is the template engine, usable as a Spring component
- **wte4j-admin** is a web fragment for managing the templates in a repository of a wte4j instance (available in maven central repository)
- **wte4j-admin-auth** is a web fragment that implements an authentication solution (available in maven central repository)
- **wte4j-admin-war** is a web app that combines **wte4j-admin** and **wte4j-admin-auth**
- **wte4j-showcase** is a small demo web app that uses **wte4j-core** and **wte4j-admin** to give a functional overview of wte4j
